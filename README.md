# Valentin and Karthik Projects

This repository contains projects that Valentin and Karthik do together. Our deliverable is a website for others to explore. The mission behind this project is to illuminate the beauty of Computer Science and its intersections with disciplines such as economics, mathematics, biology, etc. Feel free to leave a comment with some feedback and enjoy!

## Pi Calculator
This project aims to explore the challenge of approximating pi numerically. Currently, our app explores the use of the arctan(x) Taylor series to approximate pi and compares the performance to Machin's algorithm. We plan on adding more algorithms for further comparison. This project is the start of a collective website hosting projects that Valentin and Karthik do together.
